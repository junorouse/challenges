# Introduction
During the event of OffensiveCon, we launched a reverse engineering and encryption challenge and gave the attendees the change to win great prizes.

The challenge was divided into two parts, a file â€“ can be downloaded from here: https://www.beyondsecurity.com/bevxcon/bevx-challenge-1 **NOTE link is no longer valid** â€“ that you had to download and reverse engineer and server that you had to access to have a running version of this file.

The challenge could not have been resolved without access to the server as the encryption key that you were supposed to extract was only available in the running version on the server.

We had some great solutions sent to us, some of them were posted below â€“ some arrived after the deadline, and some were not eligible as their solution was incomplete, but in the end we had three winners.

First place winner got an all paid, flight and hotel, and entry to our security conference beVX in September (2018), second place prize winner got flight and entry to our security conference and the third place winner got a free entry to our event.
